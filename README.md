Nasoone is an application that allows you to collect statistics about the traffic in your network.

It is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) using the [Tauri](https://tauri.com/) framework for the GUI. The interface is built using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

To get started with development install the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) then open two terminals and run the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd src-tauri
cargo tauri dev
```
